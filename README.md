2. Open the file [ML_g6.ipynb](ML_g6.ipynb) to see how to use the model to predict the build time of a Bazel build.

3. To open the file type the following command in the terminal

    ```python
    jupyter notebook ML_g6.ipynb
    ```

4. To install the dependencies type the following command in the terminal

    ```python
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install sklearn
    pip install pandas
    pip install numpy
    pip install seaborn
    pip install statsmodels
    ```

5. Now when the file ML_g6.ipynb is opened, you can run each line one by one to see the outputs as follows
